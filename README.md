# PyOS
PyOS is a theoretical operating system written in Python

It has a command line interface and a virtual filesystem. The virtual file system is a list in Python which is encrypted and saved to the host OS on shutdown.

Recently, packages were added to PyOS. Packages enable code to be written, commited to the GitHub repo, and then downloaded to PyOS.

PyOS also includes an update system to update the code when a new release is published.

## Installation
PyOS can be installed by downloading the official file from the GitHub releases.

Running it on your computer (after installing requirements.txt) will create two files. A PyOS-system file, which contains the actual encrypted system, and a salt file, which contains the slat for the password.

## Commands
PyOS has a variety of commands to work with in the CLI. You can access a list of built-in commands by typing 'commands' in the prompt.
